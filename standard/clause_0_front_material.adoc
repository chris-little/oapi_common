== Introduction

[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC has extended their suite of standards to include Resource Oriented Architectures and Web APIs. In the course of developing these standards, some practices proved to be common accross all OGC API standards. The purpose of this standard is to document those practices. It also serves as a common foundation upon which all OGC APIs will be built. As such, this OGC API Common standard serves as the "OWS Common" standard for OGC Resource Oriented APIs.

An OGC API provides a lightweight interface to access one or more resources. The resources addressed by OGC APIs fall into three categories; Foundation Resources, Spatial Resources, and Information Resources. These Resource Categories are described in section <<rc_core-section,8>>, Requirement Class Core.

The API-Common standard defines resources and access paths that are supported by all OGC APIs. These are listed in <<tldnr>>.

|Collections metadata |`/collections` ^|GET |<<collections-metadata,Collections Metadata>>

The resources identified in <<tldnr>> primarily support Discovery operations. Discovery operations allow clients the interrogate the API to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of the resource. This includes the API definition of the server(s) as well as metadata about the resources provided by those servers.

This standard also defines common Query operations for OGC APIs. Query operations allow resources or values extracted from those resources to be retrieved from the underlying data store. The information to be returned is based upon selection criteria (query string) provided by the client. This standard only defines simple query parameters which should be applicable to all resource types. Other OGC API standards may define additional query capabilities specific to their resource type.
